grav-py
=======

experience gravy using python (pygame)

grav-py is a 2D minigame implemented with python that is inspired by osmos, angry birds, and a poster I saw in wean. Hopefully it will be completed before the end of winter break.

Most of it will be implemented with pygame

progress meter:
i) create canvas that can draw things, circles with pos/vel/acc attributes (in addition to color/size/mass)  - DONE
ii) allow mouse to control initial acceleration, simulate movement 
iii) simulate physics (gravitational attraction)
iv) create levels
v) polish
